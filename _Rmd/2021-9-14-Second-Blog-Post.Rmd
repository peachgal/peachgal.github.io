## My thoughts on R vs other softwares

### Everyone in this course had some programming experience coming in (due to the prerequisites). What are your thoughts on R vs whatever other software you've used?

I think R is a great, open-source software for data analysis if the data you are dealing with is not big data. Being an open-source software R is, has its pros and cons. Pros are since it is open-source, there are a lot of packages people developed to accomplish different needs in data analysis. However, cons are we cannot trust the results from those packages when they are not verified. When the packages are not verified, their results can be misleading in data interpretation and hence cause other problems.

R definitely has its strengths and its weaknesses. For example, plotting tools are not easy to use. Some people prefer the easier Tableau to plot, and I have to agree with them, too. Tableau is far superior to use and well-known for its graphical ability. Just imagine if we have to code all that plotting in R. It would be a chaos for me and time-consuming as well.

### What functionality do you like about R?

I definitely like R being a free, open-source software with tons of packages people developed over the years. Once those packages are verified and the outputs are correct, they are great add-on tools of R. There are a ton of packages people developed for different types of data analysis such as time-series, spatial data, and spatial-temporal data. In addition, the basic package comes with R is also great and easy to use. 

R is considered an advanced programming language like SAS, and hence, it has a lot of things running in the background already to help people code. R automates a lot of things in the background so that its users can spend more time on data analysis, less time on data preparation and extraction. Therefore, once you learn its syntax, it is very easy to code, and its syntax is not hard, either. 

### What parts do you miss about your other language?

I think the biggest drawback about R is its speed. For example, it is impossible to run big spatial data in R. When a data analysis requires a lot of memory to run due to its massive data size, it would take R hours to run it but only minutes by other non-advanced programming languages like Python. Thus, with medium-sized data set not required too much memory to run, R is great. However, when the data is huge and requires big memory to run them, a non-advanced programming language like Python is usually preferred. 

Generally speaking, the run time in R is slower than most of the non-advanced programming languages. For instance, a simple example of looping a 300 by 300 square matrix with if or else conditions may take R minutes to run but only seconds in Python. Hence, speed is what I miss about Python. 

### Do you consider R a difficult language to learn? (If you knew R prior to the course, describe your experience when first learning it.)

No, I do not think R a difficult language to learn, as least not as hard as Python. However, some people with Computer Science background may be very comfortable with programming languages like Python, C++ and Java.

I first learnt R in prior Statistical courses to manipulate data and cleanse data and prepare data for further analysis. I was mostly confused about rows and columns. I was not sure about the orders of rows and columns in a data set to extract certain information, and if there were lists involved, it would just confuse me further. Luckily, with enough R code examples from class notes and online resources, I was able to gain control of R and complete the tasks given. From my experience, comparing to Python, R was easy to learn. Python, on the other hand, was a bit harder to grasp. However, I think many people have said this already. For any programming languages, when you learn how their syntax and logic work, especially in today's world, with tons and tons of resources and tutorials online, Spend a little time on learning the language, you will be rewarded with sweet knowledge.

## R Markdown ouput to a plot

Below is an example of scatter plots of `iris` data set with 5 variables, Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, Petal.Length, Petal.Width, Species.

```{r iris, echo=FALSE}
plot(iris)
```

Below is the **render function** I used to run in the console to produce the R markdown blog post in github.

```{r eval = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
rmarkdown::render("C:/Users/peach/Documents/ST558/ST558_repos/peachgal.github.io/_Rmd/2021-9-14-Second-Blog-Post.Rmd", output_format = "github_document", 
                  output_dir = "C:/Users/peach/documents/ST558/ST558_repos/peachgal.github.io/_posts", 
                  output_options = list(html_preview = FALSE)
                  )
```
