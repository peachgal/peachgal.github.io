title: Data Science vs Statistics!
---

1. What do you think being a data scientist is about? 

   A data scientist is about gathering data from multiple sources and applying machine learning and predictive analytics to extract critical information from the collected data sets, basically pattern recognition from big data. I think data science is a concept to tackle big data with the knowledge from machine learning, statistics and computer science. 

2. What do you see as the major duties and/or knowledge areas? 

   The major duties of data scientists are collections of massive amount of data, data cleansing and transformation. Often, data scientists use a modeling process which focuses on the predictive model accuracy by comparing different machine learning algorithms and select the model with the best accuracy. 
   
   I think data science is multidisciplinary. Data scientists have to have some knowledge in Statistics and Mathematics, some knowledge in Computer Science (machine learning), and databases as well as data processing skills. 

3. What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians? 

   Statisticians and data scientists are similar in a way that they both are dealing with data such as manipulating data and analyzing data. They both apply some kind of methods to analyze data and to recognize a pattern. However, they both differ in ways that statisticians go into depth to test their model and see whether the model assumptions have been met after the model is built while data scientists focus on building the predictive accuracy of the model with bid data by comparing different machine learning algorithms and choose the model with the best accuracy. Furthermore, for different purposes of analysis, not only can statisticians build predictive models using traditional statistical methods (i.e. Frequentists or Bayesians) but also provide data/model interpretations. 
   
   I generally think the biggest difference between them is that data scientists are dealing with massive amount of data while statisticians rely on smaller scale methods of data collection. I remember in one of my statistics courses in NCSU (Spatial statistics), often time, we had to deal with large amount of data. The traditional methods such as MLE are great in estimating parameters, however, with big data, the amount of time we spent to run each analysis went exponentially as the sample sizes increased. It was crazy. That is when I learn, "different times call for different measures". Big data analysis is really important in the real world. Various methods were built to handle massive amount of spatial data. Those methods sacrifice a little bit of accuracy of the parameters but save huge amount of "time". The trade-off is well worth it. This is what I view the difference between data scientists and statisticians. 

4. How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?

   I see myself having a stronger background in Statistics than in Computer Science. I am a more Statistician than a Data Scientist. Sure, you can say I can apply my knowledge about statistical methods in different types of data sets, however, with Big Data, things change direction a little bit just like for different purposes of analyses, whether you are looking for model prediction or data interpretation, statistical methods used on the data are also different. I still have much work to do in gaining experience related to Computer Science field.
