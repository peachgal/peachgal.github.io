1. What would you do differently?
   
   I think I will fit a principal component analysis using all the predictors in the data and use the first few principal components which account for the most variations in the data to fit a linear regression for predition and see if the prediction from those PCs are better than my current models. I am actually very interested to find out. The study collected and retrieved a lot of attributes/features from those published articles on Mashable. They contain all the information about those articles. It seems like a waste when we only picked ten predictors to work with in our predictive models because we actually threw away a lot of information about our target variable. On top of that, a lot of the predictors are highly correlated with one another such as those LDA topic measures, average keywords based on average shares, minimum keywords, maximum keywords, best keywords, worst keywords and their corresponding minimums and maximums, and a lot of others. Hence, using PCA to group those highly correlated predictors together sounds logical. PCA will reduce a lot of predictors but the reduced number of PCs produced by PCA will still contain the most information about those articles.
   
2. What was the most difficult thing?
   
   I think the automation of the reports is the most difficult part especially I have no knowledge about how R Project is linked to GitHub repo. The plots produced by one channel report are overwritten by the plots produced by the next channel report generated. So at the end, I only have plots generated by one reports instead of six reports and they are placed in the wrong report as well. I am super confused about how GitHub is able to link the correct plot to the correct report at the correct place in the report. I tried many different methods and yet no avail. I tried to give the plots different names by adding the corresponding channel names in the local code chunk in "fig.path =". It did not work. I tried this method by setting it in the set up chunk. Still, it did not work. I want to emphasize that my partner and I generated a total of 10 plots for each report. During this trying process, I had more than 100 plots saved in the designated folder. I am not sure if GitHub is able to find the right plot out of so many plots for the right place in the right report though.
