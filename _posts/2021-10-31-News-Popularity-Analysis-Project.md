1. What would you do differently?
   
   I think I will fit a principal component analysis using all the predictors in the data and use the first few principal components which account for the most variations in the data to fit a linear regression for predition and see if the prediction from those PCs are better than my current models. I am actually very interested to find out. The study collected and retrieved a lot of attributes/features from those published articles on Mashable. They contain all the information about those articles. It seems like a waste when we only picked ten predictors to work with in our predictive models because we actually threw away a lot of information about our target variable. On top of that, a lot of the predictors are highly correlated with one another such as those LDA topic measures, average keywords based on average shares, minimum keywords, maximum keywords, best keywords, worst keywords and their corresponding minimums and maximums, and a lot of others. Hence, using PCA to group those highly correlated predictors together sounds logical. PCA will reduce a lot of predictors but the reduced number of PCs produced by PCA will still contain the most information about those articles.
   
2. What was the most difficult thing?
   
   I cannot stress enought to say, "RELATIVE PATH I HATE YOU". For days, I could not figure out why the plots just would not display in the .md files. I tried many approaches and was able to save them in the main folder of the repo and sub-folders of the repo but it just would not work. The plots produced by one channel report were overwritten by the plots produced by the next channel report generated. This is only the beginning of my nightmare. Then, I only have plots generated by one reports instead of six reports and they are placed in the wrong report as well. What followed is a series of more plotting and more deleting large amount of files. I even created a new repo and copied everything over, and still, no avail. I tried every approach I could think of, and I did not think "relative path" is the culprit. This project is not my first rodeo to deal with R project and GitHub. I could not figure out relative path is the culprit because I did not use it in my previous project and blog posts where plots were also produced. I had no issues with previous repo works. Thank you very much!!! Dr. Justin Post!!! I love you so much! I hope I did not ruin your weekend. 
   
   I am actually glad that I went through hell for this because I learnt something from this. I will remember this forever. At the start of facing GitHub for the first time, I was super confused about how GitHub is linked to R projects, and how it is able to connect the correct plot to the correct report at the correct place in the report. At least now I have a better understanding how GitHub does it, linking to plots to the output .md files. 
   
3. What are your big take-aways from this project?
   
   First of all, "ALWAYS" USE RELATIVE PATHS WITH R PROJECTS AND GITHUB!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
   
   Second of all, USING RELATIVE PATHS WHEN WORKING IN R PROJECTS FROM NOW ON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
   
   Finally, getting a tattoo saying, "DON'T FORGET TO USE RELATIVE PATHS IN R PROJECTS ON GITHUB"!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Joke*
   
   I learnt a lot of things about automating reports and how convenient it is to run those automated reports if I would like to update something frequently. I learnt what Dr. Post meant by commit/merge conflicts working with a partner together on repo. At first, I am scared of those because my experience with GitHub has not been pleasant, and I still cannot grasp how it functions. But slowly and surely, I understand how powerful GitHub is and why so many people are using it for projects and collaborative work. However, after experiencing some commit/merge issues, GitHub does a great job telling me where the conflicted sections are by highlighting them with erroneous syntax. I thought I had to find them in a million code chunks that my partner and I created. Turned out, it is so easy. Collaborative work is not as bad as I thought. This is awesome!
   
   By reading the study paper to learn more about our data and subjects, I learnt the cruel truth about online news and how influential they can be and how scary it is if bad guys are using it to manipulate public opnions. I think the world is changing, to be better or worse, I don't know. But, I think nowadays, people need to use their judgements more than ever when they learn something on social media. Don't trust everything you read online. There are a lot of news that are not verified nor confirmed, and they can sway people's views to good or bad direction.
