I like to hike, like to see natures. I like to sleep under the darkest sky but also with the brightest stars. People often call it "camping". I like mountains but not beaches. It may be because I grew up on an island. 

I LOVE College Football! So, I am typically very busy during the second half of the year. Best not to contact me on Saturdays!

My most recent nature encounter is a grizzly bear at Glacier National Park! Luckily, she is not a full size grizzly, maybe an older teenager. She probably thinks she was playing with us at the time, however, us humans were running for our lives away from her. I don't think I have ever run that fast in my life before. But man, she is such a beautiful creature!
